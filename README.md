# Geospatial Prioritization Tool

This web application allows Fire Managers with the National Parks Service submit
treatment proposals and generate a priority score.  The priority score can
then be compared to other proposals to determine which areas may be more
important to treat if there is a limitation (funding, time, etc).  The application
was built as part my course with with North Carolina State University MGIST program.
