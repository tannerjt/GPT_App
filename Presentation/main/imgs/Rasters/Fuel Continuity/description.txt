Description:
This layer represents how many fuel breaks are present that limit the ability of a fire
to spread.  Trails, roads, and streams were used to represent these breaks.

Layers:
Trails
Roads
Streams

Creation:
1. Polyline to raster operation on all layers (270m cell size)
2. Combine layers using weighted sum analysis (each layer has weight of 1)
3. Reclassify (0 breaks : 5 points, 1-2 breaks : 3 points, >2 breaks : 0 points)
