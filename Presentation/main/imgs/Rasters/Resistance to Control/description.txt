Description:
Using feedback from local Fire Managers, the resistance to control layer defined how hard
it is to respond to a fire due to certain conditions.  These conditions include vegetation 
(fuel) types, aspect, slope, and distance from a known road (length of hose on engine).

Layers:
Elevation (https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=58a541efc59545e6b7137f961d7de883)
Roads

Creation:
Slope and aspect were created from a digital elevation model attained from ArcGIS Online.
The roads raster was created using euclidean distance analysis from road centerline data.
These layers were added together and reclassified based on generally decided upon scores.
